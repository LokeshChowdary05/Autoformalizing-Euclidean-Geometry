### Step 1: Re-implement All Methods
This includes:

Symbolic Reasoning Engine (SMT-based) for verifying equivalence of statements.
Euclidean Equivalence Engine (E³) for logical and approximate equivalence.
LLM Interaction for Autoformalization using OpenAI API.
1.1 Symbolic Reasoning Engine (SMT-Based) Implementation
We’ll build a symbolic reasoning engine that uses the z3 library to check logical equivalence between geometric statements.
